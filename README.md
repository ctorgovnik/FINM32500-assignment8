## Interprocess Communication for Trading Systems

### Overview
In this assignment, you will design and implement a simplified multi-process trading system that uses interprocess communication (IPC) to connect independent components through real TCP sockets and shared memory.
You’ll build a mini trading stack — a Gateway, OrderBook, Strategy, and OrderManager — that communicate in real time.

This assignment emphasizes process orchestration, socket programming, serialization, and shared memory synchronization in the context of financial systems.
